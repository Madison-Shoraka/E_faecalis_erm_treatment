Image_processing_algorithm_Fig6 -> This file is the code used to generate image processing results of figure 6

      -% x-slices with protected region-> txt file of results
      
      -Structure Vol-> txt file of results
      
Simulation_Fig9 -> This file is the code used to generate the simulation results of figure 9

      -Structure Vol simulation -> txt file of results generated
      
      - tiff slices in this repo were those used for these simulations
      
      - read comments and change parameters: threshold (grey-scale threshold) and density_threshold (density at which
      
          to cut off rigid base layer) for each tiff file accordingly. Note that the post simulation results do not require these 
          
            parameters, they use the same ones or do not need them
